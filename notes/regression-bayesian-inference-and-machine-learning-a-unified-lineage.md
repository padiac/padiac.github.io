# Regression, Bayesian Inference, and Machine Learning: A Unified Lineage

## 1. Linear Regression <-> Machine Learning

**OLS as the baseline.**
Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) is the foundation of linear models; machine learning (ML) treats it as a strong baseline. Feature engineering, interaction terms, and nonlinear transforms (log, spline, piecewise) all stem from this lineage.

**Regularization as structural preference.**
Ridge and Lasso are equivalent to L2 and L1 regularization in ML; in Bayesian form, they correspond to Gaussian and Laplace priors (see next section).

**Diagnostics -> Generalization.**
Residual plots, heteroskedasticity, and autocorrelation translate to ML data cleaning, leakage detection, drift monitoring, and robustness evaluation.

## 2. Linear Regression <-> Bayesian Inference

**Ridge ~ Gaussian prior**

$$
\beta \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \tau^2 I)
$$

Posterior mode implies OLS plus an L2 penalty.

**Lasso ~ Laplace prior**

$$
\beta \sim \text{Laplace}(0, b)
$$

Posterior mode implies OLS plus an L1 penalty that prefers sparse solutions.

**Uncertainty as a first-class citizen.**
Bayesian regression yields the posterior of $\beta$ and the predictive distribution, naturally decomposing epistemic (model) and aleatoric (data) uncertainty.

**Hierarchical models.**
Partial pooling enables shared statistical strength across groups, which is critical in multi-store or multi-region business data, and something frequentist methods handle less elegantly.

**Model comparison.**
AIC and BIC correspond to WAIC and PSIS-LOO; cross-validation unifies both worlds.

## 3. GLM and Beyond

**Logistic, Poisson, Negative Binomial.**
Generalized Linear Models extend OLS via alternative likelihoods. Bayesian GLMs simply replace the likelihood and add priors.

**Gaussian Processes / Bayesian Kernel Regression.**
Move nonlinear feature engineering into function space to avoid manual feature crafting while capturing rich relationships, particularly for small-to-medium data.

## 4. Unified Engineering Workflow

- **Data contracts and splits:** Temporal and group splits prevent leakage and are universal across OLS, Bayesian, and ML pipelines.
- **Evaluation:** Combine RMSE or MAE with confidence or posterior intervals and calibration checks.
- **Monitoring:** Track input drift, residual distributions, and error decomposition; Bayesian models add prior-posterior pull checks.
- **Interpretability:** Progress from OLS coefficients to regularization paths to posterior densities or SHAP with uncertainty.
- **Deployment:** Use scikit-learn or torch pipelines, or Bayesian toolchains (NumPyro, Stan, PyMC) with variational inference or MCMC for predictive intervals.

## 5. Learning Path and Practice Loop

1. Master OLS and GLM engineering: data split, features, baseline, diagnostics, regularization, cross-validation, and monitoring.
2. Connect priors and regularization: compare OLS, Ridge, Lasso, and Bayesian regression (for example, PyMC) on the same dataset; examine coefficient posteriors and predictive intervals.
3. Climb to hierarchical modeling: for example, "store x time" sales; compare grouped regression versus hierarchical Bayes and observe stability from partial pooling.
4. Add nonlinearity: compare kernel regression or tree baselines with Gaussian process Bayes; focus on uncertainty and small-sample behavior.
5. Pipeline it: integrate train, evaluate, interval estimation, and drift monitoring via MLFlow or DVC plus CI for reproducible deployment across all paradigms.

**In one line:**
Regression teaches the syntax of modeling, Bayes adds semantics and uncertainty, and engineering ensures reliability. Align the three, and your systems will be accurate, stable, and interpretable.
