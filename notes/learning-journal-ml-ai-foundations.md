## Books and Technical References

### Core Machine Learning and Mathematics

- *Machine Learning with PyTorch and Scikit-Learn* (Raschka et al.). About 30 percent completed.
- *Mathematics for Machine Learning* (Deisenroth, Faisal, Ong). Used as needed.
- *Statistics* (Xi-Ru Chen). Currently studying.

### Advanced and Applied Topics

- *Generative AI System Design Interview*. Next phase.
- *Machine Learning System Design Interview*. Next phase.
- *Bayesian Analysis* (Lai-Sheng Wei, Wei-Ping Zhang). Planned.
- *Natural Language Processing with Transformers* (Tunstall, von Werra, Wolf). Reference text.

This list will evolve as I deepen both theoretical and engineering coverage, from foundational math to large model architectures.
