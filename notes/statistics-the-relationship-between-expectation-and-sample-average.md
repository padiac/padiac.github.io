## 1. Your Intuition: The Frequentist View

You said:
> "As we take more samples, the empirical distribution approaches the full-space distribution -- isn't that the same as the theoretical one?"

This is exactly the **frequentist definition** of probability:

$$
P(A) = \lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{\text{number of times } A \text{ occurs}}{n}, \quad
\mathbb{E}[X] = \lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n X_i
$$

Under this view, the **theoretical distribution** is nothing but the **limit of the empirical distribution** as the sample size $n \to \infty$. So you are correct in the sense that, asymptotically, there is no difference -- the two coincide.

## 2. The Modern Measure-Theoretic View: The Reverse Definition

After Kolmogorov's 1933 axiomatization, probability is defined as a **measure space** $(\Omega, \mathcal{F}, P)$ where:
- $\Omega$ is the sample space,
- $\mathcal{F}$ is the sigma-algebra of events,
- $P$ is a probability measure satisfying the Kolmogorov axioms.

In this framework:
- The probability $P(A)$ is given a priori,
- The expectation $\mathbb{E}[X] = \int X   dP$ is a theoretical constant derived from $P$,
- Observed samples are merely realizations from this distribution.

Then the **Law of Large Numbers** states that
- empirical frequency converges to theoretical probability,
- the sample mean converges to the theoretical expectation.

So logically:

> We assume the probability distribution exists,
> and then we prove that frequencies will converge to it.

It is the reverse of the frequentist view.

## 3. The Difference: Definition Order, Not Final Outcome

| Perspective | Starting Point | Meaning of Expectation | Role of Samples |
|-------------|----------------|------------------------|-----------------|
| **Frequentist** | Infinite repetitions | Limiting average | Generates "theory" |
| **Measure-theoretic** | Given distribution $P$ | $\int x   dP(x)$ | Approximates "theory" |

Thus:
- **Philosophically different**,
- **Mathematically equivalent** in the limit.

## 4. Why Modern Probability Uses the Theoretical-first Definition

If you define probability as "limiting frequency," you must first assume the limit exists, but you cannot prove that without assuming a stable distribution.

Therefore, modern probability reverses the logic:
> Define the probability space first,
> then prove that the empirical frequencies converge to it.

This provides mathematical rigor and consistency.

## 5. Closing the Loop

You are reasoning "empirical -> theoretical."
Mathematical probability reasons "theoretical -> empirical."
They meet perfectly at the Law of Large Numbers:

$$
\mathbb{E}[X] = \int x   dP(x) \\
\approx \lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n X_i
$$

The first line is the **definition**, and the second is the **theorem** that connects it to data.

## Summary

> In the infinite limit, they are indeed equivalent.
> Theoretically, however, the **distribution is the starting point**, and the **empirical average** is its approximation.
> Your intuition ("more samples -> closer to the true distribution") is exactly the **Law of Large Numbers**, which holds because we assume the theoretical distribution exists.
