Structured roadmap for the theory and engineering skills I am building across courses and books.

## Courses

### Deep Learning and Machine Learning

- **Andrew Ng - Machine Learning (Stanford / Coursera):** Completed. Classical supervised learning foundations.
- **Andrew Ng - Convolutional Neural Networks (Deep Learning Specialization #4):** Completed. Core CNN architectures, pooling, transfer learning.
- **Andrew Ng - Sequence Models (Deep Learning Specialization #5):** In progress (roughly 75 percent). RNN, LSTM, GRU, attention.
- **Udemy - LLM Engineering: Master AI and Large Language Models:** Completed. Building and deploying LLM applications.
- **DeepLearning.AI - Natural Language Processing Specialization:** Planned. Embeddings, sequence models, attention-based pipelines.
