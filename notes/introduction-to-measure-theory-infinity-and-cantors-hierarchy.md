# Introduction to Measure Theory, Infinity, and Cantor's Hierarchy

This note recaps the role of measure theory, the Lebesgue integral, and Cantor's hierarchy of infinities, highlighting why only the lower rungs see practical use in probability and analysis.

## 1. What Measure Theory Really Is

Measure theory generalizes length, area, and volume so that even highly fragmented sets can be assigned a meaningful size. A measure satisfies three axioms:

1. The empty set has measure 0.  
2. Disjoint sets add: if A_i and A_j do not overlap for i != j, then mu(union_i A_i) = sum_i mu(A_i).  
3. Countable additivity behaves consistently, even for infinite unions.

### Example: Rationals in [0,1] Have Measure Zero

Enumerate the rationals as q_1, q_2, and so on. Place an interval of width epsilon / 2^i around each q_i. The total length of all intervals is

```
epsilon/2 + epsilon/4 + epsilon/8 + ... = epsilon
```

Because epsilon can be arbitrarily small, the rationals occupy measure zero despite being dense.

## 2. Lebesgue vs. Riemann Integration

Riemann integration slices the domain (the x-axis) and sums rectangles. It fails for wildly oscillating functions such as the Dirichlet function that equals 1 on rationals and 0 on irrationals.

Lebesgue integration groups points by function value and multiplies that value by the measure of the corresponding set. For the Dirichlet function:

- Value 1 occurs on the rationals (measure zero).  
- Value 0 occurs on the irrationals (measure one).

The integral is 1 * 0 + 0 * 1 = 0, showing how Lebesgue integration ignores sets of measure zero.

## 3. Probability as Measure

Probability theory is built on measure theory. The sample space is the set of outcomes, events are subsets, and a probability measure assigns each event a number in [0,1].

For a continuous random variable, single points have probability zero, but intervals do not:

```
P(X in [a, b]) = integral_a^b f(x) dx
```

Here dx denotes the Lebesgue measure and f(x) is the density that weights it. This framework treats discrete, continuous, and mixed distributions uniformly.

## 4. Countable vs. Uncountable Infinity

Not all infinities match in size.

| Type                 | Example             | Countable? | Symbol     |
|----------------------|---------------------|------------|------------|
| Finite               | {1,2,3}             | Yes        | -          |
| Countably infinite   | Integers, rationals | Yes        | aleph_0    |
| Uncountably infinite | Reals in [0,1]      | No         | continuum  |

### Countable Infinity

Countably infinite sets can be listed: 1, 2, 3, and so on. Rationals can be listed by traversing a grid of numerator and denominator pairs.

### Uncountable Infinity: Cantor's Diagonal Argument

Assume all real numbers in [0,1] are listed:

```
x_1 = 0.12345...
x_2 = 0.98765...
x_3 = 0.50000...
```

Construct a number y that differs from the n-th number in the n-th decimal place. Then y is not in the list, so the reals cannot be counted. The continuum is strictly larger than any countable infinity.

## 5. Cantor's Power Set Theorem and the Infinite Ladder

For any set S, the power set P(S) (all subsets of S) has strictly larger cardinality than S itself, even when S is infinite:

```
|P(N)| > |N|
```

### Cantor's Second Diagonal Argument

Suppose A_1, A_2, and so on enumerate all subsets of N. Define

```
D = { n in N | n not in A_n }.
```

The set D differs from every A_n in at least element n. Hence the list misses D, so no bijection exists between N and P(N).

Iterating this construction builds an endless hierarchy:

```
aleph_0 < continuum = |P(N)| < |P(R)| = 2^continuum < 2^(2^continuum) < ...
```

Each step jumps to a strictly larger infinity.

## 6. "Usable" vs. "Existential" Infinities

Infinities up to the continuum are operational. We can compute, measure, and integrate on them; physics and probability live here.

Beyond P(R), most subsets become undefinable or non-constructible; they cannot be described or computed by finite procedures. They exist to guarantee logical completeness (for example, when building sigma-algebras) but play little direct role in applications.

## 7. Philosophical Summary

- Measure theory extends the notion of size to arbitrary sets.  
- Lebesgue integration succeeds by ignoring negligible (measure-zero) pathologies.  
- Infinities come in a strict hierarchy; some can be listed, others cannot.  
- Power sets always enlarge cardinality, yielding an infinite ladder of infinities.  
- The lower rungs are scientifically useful; the higher ones secure mathematical foundations.

**In short:** mathematics operates comfortably within the continuum, yet its logical scaffolding relies on higher infinities that remain unreachable but indispensable.
