# Introduction to Measure Theory, Infinity, and Cantor's Hierarchy

This note recaps the role of measure theory, the Lebesgue integral, and Cantor's hierarchy of infinities, highlighting why only the lower rungs see practical use in probability and analysis.

## 1. What Measure Theory Really Is

Measure theory generalizes length, area, and volume so that even highly fragmented sets can be assigned a meaningful size. A measure \(\mu\) on a measurable space \((\Omega, \mathcal{F})\) satisfies:

1. \(\mu(\varnothing) = 0\).  
2. If \(A_i \cap A_j = \varnothing\) for \(i \neq j\), then
   $$
   \mu\!\left(\bigcup_{i=1}^{\infty} A_i\right) = \sum_{i=1}^{\infty} \mu(A_i).
   $$
3. The definition is stable under limits of measurable sets (countable additivity).

### Example: Rationals in \([0,1]\) Have Measure Zero

Enumerate the rationals as \(q_1, q_2, \ldots\). Wrap each \(q_i\) with an interval of length \(\varepsilon / 2^i\). The total length is

$$
\frac{\varepsilon}{2} + \frac{\varepsilon}{4} + \frac{\varepsilon}{8} + \cdots = \varepsilon.
$$

Because \(\varepsilon > 0\) is arbitrary, the rationals occupy measure zero despite being dense in \([0,1]\).

## 2. Lebesgue vs. Riemann Integration

Riemann integration slices the domain (the \(x\)-axis) into rectangles. It fails for wildly oscillating functions such as the Dirichlet function \(f(x) = \mathbf{1}_{\mathbb{Q}}(x)\), which is \(1\) on rationals and \(0\) on irrationals.

Lebesgue integration groups points by function value instead. For the Dirichlet function,

- The value \(1\) lives on a set of measure zero (the rationals).  
- The value \(0\) lives on a set of measure one (the irrationals).

Hence

$$
\int_{[0,1]} f \, d\lambda = 1 \cdot 0 + 0 \cdot 1 = 0,
$$

illustrating how Lebesgue integration ignores measure-zero pathologies.

## 3. Probability as Measure

Probability theory equips a sample space \(\Omega\) with a measure \(\mathbb{P}\) satisfying \(\mathbb{P}(\Omega) = 1\). Events are measurable subsets \(A \subseteq \Omega\), and probabilities are measures of those sets.

For a continuous random variable \(X\) with density \(f\),

$$
\mathbb{P}(X \in [a,b]) = \int_a^b f(x) \, dx,
$$

where \(dx\) denotes the Lebesgue measure. Singletons have measure zero, but intervals have the expected weight, unifying discrete, continuous, and mixed models.

## 4. Countable vs. Uncountable Infinity

Not all infinities coincide in size.

| Type                 | Example                 | Countable? | Symbol            |
|----------------------|-------------------------|------------|-------------------|
| Finite               | \(\{1,2,3\}\)           | Yes        | -                 |
| Countably infinite   | \(\mathbb{N}, \mathbb{Q}\) | Yes    | \(\aleph_0\)      |
| Uncountably infinite | \([0,1]\)               | No         | \(\mathfrak{c}\)  |

### Countable Infinity

Countably infinite sets can be listed \(1, 2, 3, \ldots\). The rationals can be arranged by sweeping through the grid of numerator/denominator pairs.

### Uncountable Infinity: Cantor's Diagonal Argument

Assume all reals in \([0,1]\) appear in a list:

```
x_1 = 0.12345...
x_2 = 0.98765...
x_3 = 0.50000...
```

Create \(y\) by flipping the \(n\)-th digit of \(x_n\). Then \(y\) differs from every entry in at least one digit, contradicting the assumption that the list was complete. Thus \([0,1]\) is uncountable and strictly larger than a countable infinity.

## 5. Cantor's Power Set Theorem and the Infinite Ladder

For any set \(S\), the power set \(P(S)\) is larger than \(S\), even when \(S\) is infinite:

$$
|P(\mathbb{N})| > |\mathbb{N}|.
$$

### Cantor's Second Diagonal Argument

Suppose \(A_1, A_2, \ldots\) enumerate all subsets of \(\mathbb{N}\). Define

$$
D = \{\, n \in \mathbb{N} \mid n \notin A_n \,\}.
$$

The set \(D\) disagrees with each \(A_n\) on membership of \(n\), so \(D\) is absent from the list. No bijection exists between \(\mathbb{N}\) and its power set.

Iterating the construction yields an infinite hierarchy:

$$
\aleph_0 < \mathfrak{c} = |P(\mathbb{N})| < |P(\mathbb{R})| = 2^{\mathfrak{c}} < 2^{2^{\mathfrak{c}}} < \cdots
$$

Each step produces a strictly larger cardinality.

## 6. "Usable" vs. "Existential" Infinities

Cardinalities up to the continuum \(\mathfrak{c}\) directly support analysis, probability, and physics: we can compute, measure, and integrate on them.

Past \(P(\mathbb{R})\), most subsets become undefinable or non-constructible; they cannot be exhibited by any finite description. These higher-cardinality sets exist to guarantee the completeness of the theory (for example, when building \(\sigma\)-algebras), but they rarely play a tangible computational role.

---

## 7. Philosophical Summary

- Measure theory extends the notion of size to arbitrary subsets while preserving additivity.  
- Lebesgue integration triumphs by tolerating measure-zero exceptions.  
- Infinity unfolds as a hierarchy; listing elements distinguishes countable from uncountable sets.  
- Power sets strictly increase cardinality, building Cantor's endless ladder.  
- Lower rungs drive applied mathematics; loftier rungs secure its logical foundations.

---

**In short:** mathematics operates comfortably within the continuum, yet its logical scaffolding relies on higher infinities that remain unreachable but indispensable.
